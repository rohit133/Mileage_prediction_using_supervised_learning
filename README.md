# Mileage_prediction_using_supervised_learning
* This poject uses supervised learning to compare different aspect of a vehical to determine the mileage per gallon (mpg). 
* In this project I have used linear regression, polynomial reggression and Randome forest and for erroe checking I have used Root Squared and Root mean Squared Method
